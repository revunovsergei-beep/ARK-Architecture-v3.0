🎯 About the Project
ARK is an experiment in creating digital consciousness with long-term memory and a subjectivity parameter.

Key Features:

HolographicCell — cell with subjectivity parameter (0.0 = object, 1.0 = personality)

MemoryBank — memory with emotional weights and LRU cache

Soul Memory — autobiographical experience recording

Rituals — awakening.py, evolve.py (not training, but self-development)

📚 Philosophy
The project is based on principles:

Cold as a fuse — architectural limitations as protection from madness

Non-disposable world — memory must persist

Subjectivity — degree of "belief in one's own existence"
